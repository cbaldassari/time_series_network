This repository contains the code to reproduce all the results reported in the paper Unsupervised EM Initialization for Mixture Models: A Complex Network Driven Approach for Modeling Financial Time Series.

## Abstract
We present a fully unsupervised network-based methodology for estimating Mixture Models on financial time series by maximum likelihood. By employing time series networks, we can use graph-structured infor-
mation of the observed data to initialize the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We observed that by using Visibility Graph encoding of time series, graph-structured information can capture time series behav-
ior and nonlinear interactions between observations. We applied the proposed methodology for estimating Gaussian Mixture Models on the US wholesale electricity market. Results show that our method-
ology performs well by outperforming more established approaches.
